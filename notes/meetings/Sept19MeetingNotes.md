## Meeting Summary 2024.09.19

1. **Puzzle Transformation Overview:**

- **Pixel-level Operations:**

  - Add
  - Delete
  - Move 
  - Change Color

- **Object-level Operations:**

  - Add and Delete: Similar to pixel-level but on a group of pixels.

  - Move Operations: (ex. rotate, translate, symmetric flipping, exchanging colors between different blocks, etc.)

    

2. **Data Representation:**

â€‹Use a key-value pair data representation approach, abandoning the 	traditional matrix format. An example representation being `(i, j, c)`, 	where `i` and `j` denote the row and column positions, respectively, and 	`c` represents the color index.



3. **Long-term Planning:**

The development plan is structured into three phases:

- **Phase 1:** Start with manually written scripts for the puzzle generator focusing on a simple type of rule, such as color change.
- **Phase 2:** Transition to scripting rules in text form, which are then processed by a large language model to create puzzle generators automatically.
- **Phase 3:** Employ LLM to analyze existing puzzle problems (e.g., daily puzzles) to learn the underlying rules. The LLM would then use these rules to generate code for new puzzle generators.



4. **Current Task and Team Assignments:**

   The primary objective is to build an end-to-end pipeline for Kaggle submissions, initially focusing on simple puzzles involving color changes. The project is divided among three teams:

   1. **Color Map Generation Team:** Creating a generator that can develop puzzles based on color changing.
   2. **Puzzle Solver Team:** This team will develop a solver that learns the color map from a given training dataset and then applies the map to solve test puzzles.
   3. **Evaluator Team:** Building an evaluation tool to calculate the accuracy of the puzzle solutions generated by the solver.
