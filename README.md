### Data Download

To download the data using the Kaggle CLI install it with

```
pip install kaggle
```
Then create an authentification token on Kaggle and add it to the folder `~/.kaggle/` on your machine. Then download 

```
mkdir data
cd data
kaggle competitions download -c arc-prize-2024
```

### Test File Format of Input and Submission Files

To use pytest install it with

```
pip install pytest
```

Then run the tests 

```
cd source/tests
pytest test_data_format.py
```

Currently the tests only check the json files provided by kaggle. Later it will be possible to test the puzzles generated by our puzzle generator and the submission files generated by the solver.
